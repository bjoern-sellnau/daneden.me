It’s almost parody how common it is for designers to frequently and publicly
redesign their website.
[Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/)
and [Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/redesign/) are two such
people who quite publicly went through their own flavours of dismantling and
patiently reassembling their websites, and here I am experiencing my own
[Popeye moment](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/popeye/) and reflecting on
the longevity of the former lives of my website’s design.

It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that this moment reaches me almost exactly 10
years after the first snapshot of my website was added to the
[Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://daneden.me).
Unfortunately, the majority of (the 1,000+) snapshots are broken: years of
interchanging URLs, web stacks, technologies, and designs are commensurate with
the broken links to the resources that held the designs in place. Nevertheless,
I can start to trace a route over the years.

The current design (as of April 29, 2021) has been practically
unchanged—structurally speaking, at least—since
[July 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190724200747/https://daneden.me/),
which is a pretty long time! Prior to this iteration, the design changed fairly
substantially every 2–3 months.

I’m starting to chip away at the site’s latest iteration, one small change at a
time. There are two goals in this exercise:

1. Make the website fast
2. Showcase my work

The first goal is the only dealbreaker. I feel I’ve written a lot of useful
posts, but that content is only useful if it’s accessible, and accessible
_quickly_. I’m trying _really_ hard to toe the line between optimising for speed
and optimising for expressing myself and my “brand”. Materially, this means
being selective in which web fonts I choose, what content loads on the key
pages, and how much I prioritise certain routes through the site by choosing
certain navigation items.

The second goal is taking me back to my first few years as an aspiring designer:
the websites I designed peppered my portfolio, and I wore the projects like a
Boy Scout sash. In the last year alone, I’ve enjoyed working on a handful of new
projects, mostly independently designed and built iOS apps. There are a lot of
details in some of these projects that I’m quietly proud of, and I’d love to
share some of those projects with a bit more depth.

Following the footsteps of others, I’m hoping to document this process in the
public eye, with this blog post as my first stop on the journey.

## April 29, 2021

This morning, I made the first opinionated design choice: the typeface.

In keeping with the redesign’s primary goal—make the website fast—I first chose
[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/), a beautiful typeface from former Dropbox
colleague [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me). It’s close enough to the macOS
system font, San Francisco, that I can leverage `font-display: swap` to switch
between them while the web font downloads, and it’s vanilla enough to have made
for a good starting point for a redesign.

However, dear reader, now is as good a time as any to admit that I am _obsessed_
with street signage typography.

    alt={`A British road sign for the A46, set in the Transport typeface, with distances to Lincoln, Newark, Nottingham, and Leicester`}
/>

I’ve wanted for a long time to have an excuse to use
[Transport](http://www.newtransport.co.uk) or
[Interstate](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/interstate), and a redesign felt like
a good excuse. Luckily, I found [Overpass](https://overpassfont.org), an open
source font hosted on Google Fonts, which has excellent delivery strategies for
performant websites; so that’s what I’ve picked, for now at least.

Who knows whether Overpass will end up in the final version of this iteration,
but right now I feel good about it. It feels utilitarian without being cold, and
satisfies a personal, selfish itch.
